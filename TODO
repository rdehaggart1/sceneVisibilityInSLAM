Check InteriorNet against ground truth (and set up the full automation script like MidAir)
Do the flaggng process on generate IMU data like bag file
InteriorNet documentation and report work
Add visibility measurement to the bottom of the frame
test some down camera extracts to see how well it tracks on orb
See if we can mark all extracted points on the frame to see distribution and compare
get some visibility out of interiornet. ideally maintaining track throughout for real time insight
test that malaga extract to see effects of lens flare
use bagpy to find midair bag start time and subtract it
more function tidying
arrange midair data into pandas structure for processing instead of loads of lists
generate noisy interiornet imu data? plot it first and see if it looks noisy (also it might be in world frame!)

Generate a table of MidAir trajectories (different conditions) with median RMSE over a few executions and some average visibility. *hopefully* we'll see lower visibility means lower accuracy... Also include a tracking time (e.g. 0:04 - 0:59 seconds out of 70 or whatever)

Plot goals:
3D trajectory plotting on single axes   [DONE]
3 2D subplots, overlaying groundtruth and estimation in each axis   [DONE]
Plot of absolute error over time    [DONE]
Plot of visibility over time    [DONE - not happy with results so far!]
