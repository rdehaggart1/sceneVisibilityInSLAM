Check ViViD against ground truth (and set up the full automation script like MidAir)
Apply ground truth attitude again
Do the flaggng process on generate IMU data like bag file
ViViD documentation and report work
Get trajectory error plot and total (RMSE)
Adjust SVE metrics to make more sense? c seems consistently low, b seems consistently high...
Add visibility measurement to the bottom of the frame
Add midair calibration files to folder


Plot goals:
3D trajectory plotting on single axes
3 2D subplots, overlaying groundtruth and estimation in each axis
Plot of absolute error over time
Plot of visibility over time
