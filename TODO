Check ViViD against ground truth (and set up the full automation script like MidAir)
Apply ground truth attitude again
Do the flaggng process on generate IMU data like bag file
ViViD documentation and report work
Adjust SVE metrics to make more sense? c seems consistently low, b seems consistently high...
Add visibility measurement to the bottom of the frame

Generate a table of MidAir trajectories (different conditions) with median RMSE over a few executions and some average visibility. *hopefully* we'll see lower visibility means lower accuracy... Also include a tracking time (e.g. 0:04 - 0:59 seconds out of 70 or whatever)

Plot goals:
3D trajectory plotting on single axes   [DONE]
3 2D subplots, overlaying groundtruth and estimation in each axis   [DONE]
Plot of absolute error over time    [DONE]
Plot of visibility over time    [DONE - not happy with results so far!]
