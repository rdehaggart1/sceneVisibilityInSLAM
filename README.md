# Online Scene Visibility Estimation as a Complement to SLAM in UAVs
As part of the final year research project with the University of Sheffield, with the title above, this repository contains supplementary code
to format data and present results. There are two folders contained in this root:
- Malaga
- MidAir


# Getting Started
The code processes these datasets for use with the V-SLAM algorithm, ORB-SLAM2, and the VI-SLAM algorithm, VINS-Mono. The latter requires that you have Robot
Operating System (ROS) installed, and this is most stable on Linux platforms and it is therefore recommended that Linux is used.
## Prerequisites 
- ROS
- ORB-SLAM2
- VINS-Mono
- Python
- Packages
